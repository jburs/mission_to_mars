# mission_to_mars

Python, Flask, MongoDB, splinter, beautifulsoup, and pandas

An application was created that scrapes data, using splinter and beautiful soup, from a variety of websites collecting information and images on mars. This data was stored using MongoDb, and displayed as a website using flask. A button is available to scrape updated data to refresh the site. The following are images of the completed project.
